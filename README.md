# Datacamp-sql-practice
This repository is the work I completed to practice SQL commands from the Datacamp course Joining Data in SQL. I do not own the lesson, or the material used to teach it. This is to serve only as a place to create databases through sqlite3 in python to practice query commands in SQL within your own environment offline.
