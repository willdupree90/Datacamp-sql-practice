# Datacamp-sql-practice
This repository is the work I completed to practice SQL commands from the Datacamp course Joining Data in SQL. I do not own the lesson, or the material used to teach it. This is to serve only as a place to create databases through sqlite3 in python to practice query commands in SQL within your own environment offline.

This project contains 12 files. Nine csv files containing table data, sql file dump containing database creation commands, and two Jupyter Notebook files. The first notebook will create a .db file in environment memory that will serve as object of exploration for the Datacamp course. The second notebook is my reproduction of the excersises supplied by Datacamp, I do not intellectually own or modify the exercises, just give my results and how I ran them in my own system using Jupyter notebooks and Python. Please do not distribute this with out acknowledgement to both Datacamp and myself (I have no association to their business, only the work I created here).
